                    //note the syntax here...it's still a regular function, like the two above it, but we omit the word "function." It just makes it easier to read and write since it's cleaner, but it works the same.

                        console.log("this user has written the following blogs: ");

                //update properties using square bracket notation instead of .notation. Can be useful to know how to do this, though dot notation is probably faster/easier. Pay attention...must be entered as string (note the quotation marks around name)

                //methods look like regular functions but they're defined on the object.

                //creating a method for this object. Calling it login. This is how you call it:

                user.login();
                user.logout();

                //method to log out blogs, the array in the object
                //need to use 'this' to access it.
                //'this' is tricky with methods. We set the method up with a regular function because otherwise, 'this' would refer to the window object, not the object we've created (user, in this case).

               user.logBlogs();

         //Reference Values vs. Primitive Values

            //first, the primitive values:
            let scoreOne = 50;
            let scoreTwo = scoreOne;

            console.log(`scoreOne: ${scoreOne}`, `scoreTwo: ${scoreTwo}`);

            scoreOne = 100;
            console.log(`scoreOne: ${scoreOne}`, `scoreTwo: ${scoreTwo}`);

            //note, in the example above, scoreOne changed, but scoreTwo DID NOT. Because it's in the stack. It's its own copy since it is a primitive value.

            //now, the reference values:
            const user1 = { name: 'ryu', age: 30};
            user2 = user1;
            console.log(user1, user2);

            //now, what if I change the name here?
            user1.name = 'Jenny';
            console.log(user1, user2);

            //Oop! They BOTH change! Why? Because objects aren't stored on the stack. They're stored on the heap. When I "copied" user1 to make user2, I only copied the LINK to the info in the heap. User 2 didn't get its own information. It just pointed to the same object that user1 pointed to. So if I change that info for user1, I defacto change it for user2 as well. Be aware!
