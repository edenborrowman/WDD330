        <p>Buttons seem like they should all be the same. I mean, isn't a button a button?</p>
        <p>It turns out the answer is "no." Button written as input &lt;type="button"&gt; is used for creating buttons in a form. Inside a regular &lt;button&gt; tag, you can place text or images. Depending on what you put in your JavaScript, this kind of button can do almost anything. If you want to have a button that you click that makes a picture of Napoleon Dynamite appear, you can make it happen with this. On the other hand, the input button has a very specific job. It's designed to automatically submit a form...and that's it. It's not flexible like it's similarly-named brother. They sound the same on the surface but do something different in reality and a web developer would do well to remember the difference. </p>
